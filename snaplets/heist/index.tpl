  <h4>Learning Snap</h4>

  <p>
    Learning a new web framework is hard. Period.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learning something new places significant demand on your cognitive resources
    and takes time to build fluency. Once you get past the standard Hello World
    introduction to a new technology, you'll find a whole ecosystem of
    abstractions, architectures, libraries, conventions, templating languages,
    database APIs, and testing methodologies.
  </p>

  <h4>The whole stack</h4>

  <p>
    If you're coming to Haskell from another language, or coming to Hasell web
    development from another domain, it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed
    by all of the layers and components in a typical web stack. And even if
    you've been at it for years, no two frameworks or database/session/caching
    APIs are the same.
  </p>

  <h4>Learning by example</h4>

  <p>
    Everyone has their own learning style, and in the Haskell world it's usually
    expected that you'll start with first principles and build from there. We
    support that style of learning, but there are many resources out there
    (<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Learning_Haskell">books</a>,
    <a href="http://snapframework.com/docs">framework docs</a>,
    <a href="http://planet.haskell.org/">blogs</a>, etc.) that will set you on
    the right path.
  </p>

  <p>
    What's often missing is a wide range of example cases, presented
    <i>in context</i>, to give beginners a solid starting point, fully working
    code, and the motivation to keep learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site aims to fill that gap by providing interactive examples with
    inline, viewable source and templating code using Snap, Heist, and the
    digestive-functors library for HTML forms. You can even clone the site from
    its <a href="https://github.com/ericrasmussen/digestive-heist-demos">
    GitHub repo</a> to view, run, and modify the code locally as you learn Snap.
