<h4>Examples Overview</h4>

<p>
  Heist is a Haskell templating library commonly used with the Snap Framework.
  Heist keeps business logic out of the templates by giving you facilities for
  manipulating the templates in code. For instance, extracting and repeating
  template nodes from code instead of having a special template syntax for
  looping and conditions.
</p>

<p>
  Digestive Functors is a Haskell form library inspired by Formlets and
  providing a succinct API for building and validating forms. You can use this
  library independent of any web framework or templating system, but the
  examples here will use it exclusively with Snap and compiled Heist.
</p>

<p>
  Although each of the libraries used here have nice documentation and a few
  examples, there aren't many (or at the time of this writing, *any*) examples
  showing how they all work together. The aim of this site is to show off how
  easy and effective it is to build a form-heavy website using this libraries,
  and to offer a fully working codebase that you can clone and experiment with.
